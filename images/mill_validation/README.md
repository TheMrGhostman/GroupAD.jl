# MIL results evaluated at $n$ validation samples

These pictures present results for MIL datasets (test AUC) for all models. For every number of anomalous samples in validation data $(n = \{ 1,2,5,10,20,50,100 \})$ the best model was chosen. The results were averaged for different chosen anomalies in validation dataset.
